As a jack-of-all-trades bioinformatician, I started in the biotechnology industry and slowly transitioned to academic biomedical research. I have a broad spectrum of experience through various roles in the biotechnology and healthcare industry, coupled with an even wider interest in all things intersection of biology and technology.

As a Research Bioinformatician at Cedars-Sinai, I apply my bioinformatics and scientific computing expertise to understand the gene regulation of epithelial ovarian cancer and endometriosis. I have over seven years of experience working collaboratively with bench scientists, graduate students, post-docs, clinical researchers, physicians, and bioinformaticians in various muti-omics and epidemiology projects.

I am skilled in scientific programming (bash, python, SQL, and R) and bioinformatics (pipeline development and data analysis for NGS-based omics) with working knowledge in HPC and cloud computing. I have led pilot studies for applying new NGS assays in ovarian cancer research, developed and documented best programming and data visualization practices, and mentored undergraduate interns in their bioinformatics projects. I also wrangled clinical/survey data and conducted statistical analysis. I am passionate about finding innovative solutions to complex biological problems and advancing the field of precision medicine.
