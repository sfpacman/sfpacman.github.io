A jack-of-all-trades Bioinformatician - I start out in the biotechnology industry and slowly transition to academic biomedical research. I have a broad experience to work in different roles in the biotechnology and health care industry with even broader interests in all things at the intersection of biology and technology. 

As a Research Bioinformatician at Cedars-Sinai, I apply my expertise in bioinformatics and scientific computing to understand the gene regulation of epithelial ovarian cancer and endometriosis. I have over six years of experience in working collaboratively with bench scientists, graduate students, physicians, and bioinformaticians in various muti-omics and epidemiology projects.

I am skilled in scientific programming (bash, python, SQL, and R) and bioinformatics (pipeline development and data analysis for NGS-based omics) with working knowledge in HPC and cloud computing. I have led pilot studies for applying new NGS assays in ovarian cancer research, developed and documented best practices in programming and data visualization, and mentored undergraduate interns in their bioinformatics projects. I am passionate about finding innovative solutions to complex biological problems and advancing the field of precision medicine
